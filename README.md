Source code and resources for LoveCalculator PWA

This is an example of a Progressive Web App build using the Ionic framework to demonstrate how apps can be written to run on cross-platform mobile devices.
The code and resources in this example has been tested on limited Android and iOS devices only.
However, intention is for the code to run properly on all mobile devices. The code concept and approach are based on many sources.
Specifically, the following are supported:
1. Save app to home screen from a PWA supported mobile browser - Safari on iOS 11.2+ and Chrome on Android.
2. Will bring up splash screen when app is launched.
3. App will function even when off-line after it had been saved on the home screen.

This is a very simple game-like example and does not make internet calls.
Feel free to experiment and provide feedback to francis.tse8@gmail.com.
